# EclipseRunApplicationCleaner

A small program for deleting Eclipse Run Application configurations

Eclipse creates RunApplication configurations in the WorkPlace folder's *.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.debug.core/.launches* directory.

It would get annoying if lots of configurations are there but not in use. This program provides the GUI for deleting unwanted ones.

**Remember** to restart Eclipse after deleting the RunApplication configurations.
